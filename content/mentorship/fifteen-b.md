Spend a semester writing code and learning more about software and product development! Accepted students work on a project (of their own choosing) paired with a mentor, becoming a part of the larger development community.

__FAQ:__

- How does it work?

    Work on a project/Increase your skills in a field your interested in like web, mobile, or game development by working with a mentor that specializes on that field.

    The project can be anything, from an idea or project you have to an open source project you want to contribute on.

- Do I need to be a part of CSI/be taking up Computer Science?

    No, we are open to everyone!

- I don't have a project idea, can I still join?

    Yes, though we highly encourage you to have one! You can reach out to us and we'll help you generate ideas (and note that you can still change/pivot your idea as we go through the camp)

- Where/When does it occur?

    The 1-on-1 mentorship setup allows us to hold the devcamp without a centralized location/time, so you are free to work with your mentor on terms that works for both of you!

    However, we do sometimes hold _common sessions_, where we discuss essential things that would be common to whatever field you are studying. They are typically held in discussion rooms and will depend on the participants' availability.

- How do I get paired with a mentor? What if more than one camper picks the same mentor?

    The pairing will be done depending on the interest, specialty, and schedule of the mentor/mentee pair. To ensure the quality of mentorship, a mentor can only have one mentee.
